## Final project - 

There will be two projects to complete over the next 5 classes:

- Weather "App"
- Simple Matching/Memory game

Your goal will be to manage your time and make your best effort to complete both projects. 
I will provide as much time as possible in class to work but it will also require time outside of class. 
Working outside of class keep note of the time you spend. Also keep track of issues you may have, 
with the goal of bringing issues to class for discussion.

Think of this as a job. Think of it as an experiment. Think of it as research. Knowing the time you 
spend on a project is valuable information. Your goal while working on these final projects will 
be to track the time spent. 

## Project 1 Weather app

This is a web page that displays the current weather data in a web page. It has a field where you 
can enter the name of a city. 

Make this app more about design. Put your effort into making this look really good.
Start by finding some inspirations. Designing a weather app is almost a rite of passage for designers. 
You'll find many weather app examples on the internet. Color and typography will play a big role. 

Take a look at some examples, note the features that you like: 

- https://dribbble.com/search?q=weather+app
- https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=weather%20app&rs=typed&term_meta[]=weather%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=app%7Ctyped
- https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&sort=appreciations&time=week&search=weather%20app

The example uses the OpenweatherMap API. This API provides the following data.

**Display Info**

- Temperature
- Min, Max temp
- Location Name
- Location coordinates
- Icon/Image showing weather condition
- Weather description
- Weather detail description 
- Pressure 
- Humidity
- Wind: speed, direction
- Clouds 
- Date 
- Sunrise, Sunset times

_Feel free to modify this list to better fit your design._

You will need to create some assets for the project. 
Here is a list:

**Assets:**

- Design for weather app. Use Sketch to create a design for your app.
- Weather icons for openweathermap condition codes
    - http://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
- Images and other art for background and buttons etc.
    - Try and produce as much of this via CSS as you can. 

**Time**

This is a rough guide to the minimum amout of time you should spend. 

- Examine the example project 1hr
- Create a design in Sketch 2hr
- Markup 1hr
- CSS 3hr
- JavaScript 2hr

**Challenges**

Before trying the challenges be sure to get the basic features working. 

- Show a 5 day forecast
- 


## Project 2 Matching Game

Your game should display a grid of 16 squares. Tapping a square should reveal an image. 
Tappng a second square should reveal a second image. If the images match they stay open, 
otherwise the images disappear and the grid squares go back to their original state.

The goal of this assignment is to work on your programming skills. 

**Assets:**

- Create a design for your game in Sketch.
- Rather than an color use an image for matching. 
    
**Time** 

This is the minimum amount of time you should spend.

- Create a design for your game in Sketch 2hr.
- Markup 2hr
- JavaScript 4hr
    
**Challenges:**

- Add timer that starts counting from the first tile click.
- Count the number of clicks to finish the game. 
- Check for completed game, all tiles revealed. 
- Match 3 tiles instead of 2.
- Choose the size of the grid, should probably be divisible by 2.

## Time and Schedule 

You should keep track of the time you spend on these two projects as you work. Use a tool to help 
you track your time. 

- Toggl - This a great time tracking tool. They have a web site, and app. 

Log your hours between each class. Try to devote 6 hours per week! In reality this would be two 9 hour 
days on a job. 

- class 5 - 
- class 6 - 
- class 7 - 
- class 8 - 
- class 9 - 
- class 10 -
