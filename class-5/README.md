## Final project - 

There will be two projects to complete over the next 5 classes:

- Weather "App"
- Simple Matching/Memory game

Your goal will be to manage your time and make your best effort to complete both projects. 
I will provide as much time as possible in class to work but it will also require time outside of class. 
Working outside of class keep note of the time you spend. Also keep track of issues your may have, 
with the goal of bringing issues to class for discussion.

Think of this as a job. Think of it as an experiment. Think of it as research. Knowing the time you 
spend on a project is valuable information. Your goal while working on these final projects will 
be to track the time spent.
