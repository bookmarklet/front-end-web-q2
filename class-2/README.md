### The box model

Every element in HTML is a box. Think of each box as a rectangle.
The box model describes the space a rectangle fills.

- content width/height
- padding
- border
- margin

### I do we do - Style inputs

Use the box model to design an input field using the CSS properties above.

Students follow up by styling the other inputs. Feel free to talk with and
discuss this with your neighbors.

### Continue styling your Login form

...

### Break

...

### Investigate and apply - :focus

The :focus pseudo class selects a form element when that element
has focus. Use this to change the appearance of a form element to show that it
is the current focus of input.

- Review your selectors: https://flukeout.github.io
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus

Try the following:

- Change the background color of the input on :focus
- Change the border color

### Demo - CSS Transform

Transform gives you control over:

- position
- scale
- rotation

Try it for yourself: http://codepen.io/soggybag/pen/qqERyz

__Challenges__

Using CSS Transforms try the following on your Login form:  

- Move an element on the screen with translate().
  - Apply a translate on :active on the button which moves the button 2px down.
  - Apply a translate to the label to move it up when the input has focus.
- Scale an element on the screen with scale().
  - Scale the button smaller when it is active.
  - Scale the input larger when it has focus.
- Rotate an element on the screen with rotate().
  - Do something crazy and unexpected with rotate()...

### 4 - Create a form (10 mins)

Create a form...

### Break - Relax and reflect...

Take a break.

### 5 - Create your form! (10 mins)

Write your form in an HTML file.
Don't think about styles too closely at this point.
What's most important is creating the structure with the understanding that the
style will be applied through CSS.

### 6 - Translating visuals into code with CSS (5 mins)

- Review styles that can be applied to forms.
- Review the box model.
- Using padding and margin.
- Border styles.
- Set font styles.

### 7 - Translate example into CSS (10 mins)

Apply styles to the example form.

### 8 - Translate your design into code (20 mins)

Use the ideas from class to apply styles to your form.
The goal is to create the form you designed at the beginning of class with Sketch.

## Challenges

- Continue working and improving your Login form.
    - Think about animation and user interaction that might be apart of your form.
- Create another form. Yes, really do it all again! The best way to learn and expand your skill is practice.
    - Apply styles to a form you created for a project you are working on.
- Create a Sign Up form. Similar to the Login a Sign Up form will have some differences.
    - Mock up the new Sign Up form with Sketch first!
    - Imagine the Login and Sign Up form and how it will display and how your app will transition to it from the Login.
- Find some Login and Sign Up forms on Pinterest that you like try and recreate one of these.
