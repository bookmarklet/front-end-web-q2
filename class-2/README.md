# Front end Web Q2 - Class 2

## Objectives

- Study the box model
- Investigate and apply CSS
- Investigate Interaction Patterns

### The box model

Every element in HTML is a box. Think of each box as a rectangle.
The box model describes the space a rectangle fills.

- content width/height
- padding
- border
- margin

### I do we do - Style inputs

Use the box model to design an input field using the CSS properties above.

Students follow up by styling the other inputs. Feel free to talk with and
discuss this with your neighbors.

### Investigate and apply - :focus

The :focus pseudo class selects a form element when that element
has focus. Use this to change the appearance of a form element to show that it
is the current focus of input.

- Review your selectors: https://flukeout.github.io
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus

Try the following:

- Change the background color of the input on :focus
- Change the border color

### Demo - CSS Transform

Transform gives you control over:

- position
- scale
- rotation

__Challenges__

Using CSS Transforms try the following on your Login form:  

- Move an element on the screen with translate().
  - Apply a translate on :active on the button which moves the button 2px down.
  - Apply a translate to the label to move it up when the input has focus.
- Scale an element on the screen with scale().
  - Scale the button smaller when it is active.
  - Scale the input larger when it has focus.
- Rotate an element on the screen with rotate().
  - Do something crazy and unexpected with rotate()...
