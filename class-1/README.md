### 1 - Why design a login screen? (5 mins)

The Login screen is important. It is often the first part of your product that
people interact with. It is also the first place where people get turned off
by your product. The Login screen should look good, be inviting and easy to use.

You all have probably created projects with Login screens. Working the design of
the login screen has practical application.

The Login screen is smaller with fewer parts which makes it a good place to
start working on your design skills.
